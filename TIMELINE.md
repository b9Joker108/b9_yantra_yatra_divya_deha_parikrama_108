## Notes

- Timeline is living document, updated throughout journey
- Not every site requires equal documentation—some are brief visits, others extended stays
- Include both "successful" visits and those where access was denied or circumstances prevented full experience
- Be honest about challenges, mistakes, difficult moments
- Celebrate serendipity and grace
